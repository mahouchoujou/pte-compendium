# **Mahou's PTE Translation Module**

This module is a bit buggy as it's my first time exporting it outside of my own system and those bugs will be fixed but there is a bit to talk about.
Currently, the compendium has almost every item available in Pokémon Tabletop Evolution from the Rule Book released on **January 16th, 2025** which means the version is currently supported up to **Version 1.33**.

# DISCLAIMER AND INSTRUCTIONS!

For the move effects, I made a rookie mistake and had them imported from another compendium. To fix this mistake until the next patch fixes it manually, for any moves that have an automated effect, change the following UUID of the effect linked to the move to the one located in the Complete Compendium. See the gif attached for details.

### **No Pokémon have been altered.** 
For now, until the next update of the patch, please use the standard Pokémon Tabletop Reunited system species and modify them to fit PTU. I will release Pokémon in patches, going one 'Dex at a time. Hotfixes and bugs will be released faster than that, but Pokémon will be an ongoing process.

To properly set up your Foundry for Pokémon Tabletop Evolution, the recommended settings are listed below. These are to be changed in the Pokémon Tabletop Reunited settings tab in your "Configure Game Settings" option.

Lastly, for Quick Insert, using the Compendium Browser located at the bottom of the sidebar, change the settings to reflect the ones I've shown below in order to get rid of the PTR content and replace it with PTE content.
